## IT

Hi, I'm Szymon Miks **Software Engineer** based in **Lębork, Poland**.

I've been working in IT industry since **2016**.

My first contact with programming was in junior high school, and it was C++ :smile:

I started my professional career with PHP and HTML/CSS as a web developer in a small company in my home city
[Lębork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C4%99bork).
Then I was charmed by Python and I decided to start a new journey as a Python developer  :snake:

**Topics that I'm interested in:**
- software engineering
- craftsmanship
- clean architecture
- clean code
- design patterns
- pragmatism in software development
- microservices
- modular monoliths
- DDD (Domain Driven Design)
- CQRS
- event sourcing
- event storming

Occasionally, I do blog about topics related to software engineering.

I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges to grow my skills.
I love Python and the whole environment and community around this language.

PS.
I love sunny weather and the sea! :sunglasses: :sunny: :ocean:
I'm a lucky man because my city is near [Łeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81eba) city
so most of my free time during summer I spend there.
