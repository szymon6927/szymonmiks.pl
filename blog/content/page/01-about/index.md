## IT

Hi, I'm Szymon Miks **Software Engineer** based in **Lębork, Poland**.

I've been working in IT industry since **2016**.

My first contact with programming was in junior high school, and it was C++ :smile:

My professional career I started with PHP and HTML/CSS as a web developer in a small company in Lębork. 
Then I was charmed by Python and I decided to start a new journey as a Python developer  :snake:

**Topics that I'm interested in:**
- software engineering
- craftsmanship
- clean architecture
- clean code
- design patterns
- pragmatism in software development
- microservices
- modular monoliths

Occasionally, I do blog about topics related to software engineering.

I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges to grow up my skills. 
I love Python and the whole environment and community around this language.
