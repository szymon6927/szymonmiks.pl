## Intro

Programming is not the only hobby I have.

Because of that, this blog post will be different from others.
There is nothing about IT, code, or Python here.

My second biggest hobby just after IT is martial arts.
You probably noticed it while reading the [About](/about) page.
A few weeks ago my coach asked me if I want to take part in a kickboxing tournament.
I agreed which made me take part in my first kickboxing amateur fight.

Let’s be honest, I’m not a professional fighter, will not be, and don’t even want to be.

There are two reasons why I decided to have this fight:
- I wanted to see how my mind will behave, will I be stressed, will I be scared, etc.
- I wanted to challenge myself and feel the adrenaline


## The fight :facepunch:

I'm the guy wearing the red helmet.

## Summary

I hope I represented the IT community well enough :muscle:.

I lost the fight, but the result does not matter to me.
For me, the important thing was that I was not stressed nor scared.
I lost the second round because of a lack of stamina.
Speaking about stamina, it’s an interesting experience when your head wants to do something but your body does not allow it :smile:.

If you are in a fight there are only two options:
- you can be knocked down
- you can fight and try to win

I've been there :smile: and after all of it, this gives me a different perspective on "not giving up" in real life.

Anyway, it was an enjoyable experience :wink:.
