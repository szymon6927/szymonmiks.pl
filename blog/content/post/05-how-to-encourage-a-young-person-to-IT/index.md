This blog post will be very short. 

A few days ago I had the pleasure to encounter two YouTube presentations from [Sławomir Sobótka](https://bottega.com.pl/trener-slawomir-sobotka) . 
It was during the **CheckIT** conference.

I would like to share them with you. It’s the best way how you can encourage a young person to start thinking about his or her career in IT.

If you know some young person who is passionate about computers, electronics - share it with him or her.

It could be beneficial if he or she is still before decisions about which high school to choose :wink:

Both of them are in Polish. :flag-pl:
