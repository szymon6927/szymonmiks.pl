## Intro

Hi everyone, my name is Szymon and while writing this blog post I work as a Python Developer 🐍  at Netguru.


## Quick history

I'm from a small city in the north of Poland next to Gdańsk - Lębork. 
A few months ago when I was studying at the Technical University of Gdańsk I had to commute to my university every week.
And that time was very abundant to me because I had a lot of time for listening to podcasts. 
Btw yeah I'm a huge fan of podcasts so if you would like to talk to me about it, please don't hesitate!

## Reason why 😉

I was listening to one of the podcasts (sorry but I don't remember the name, too much of them 😄 ) 
when the guest was Andrzej Krzywda from Arkency. 
Btw if you don't know this guy I recommend you to get acquainted with his creation. 
He was talking about blogging for programmers and how he started with his blog and blogging journey at all.

Two key ideas remained in my memory.

> Document. Don’t create.
> 

and the second one

> Your English is good enough.
> 

I was thinking about creating my blog for some time, 
but when I was thinking about it then it scared me, 
as a typical programmer I thought about technical things: hosting, domain, CMS, cloud provider, and many many other things. 
It was causing only my frustration and I walked away from the topic of blogging. 
This situation was repetitive over and over again until I've heard this podcast! 
Thank you, Andrzej, for that 😉 Of course it took me some time to convince myself to start blogging but these two factors were game-changers.

And yeah that's the **"reason why".**

## What you will find on my blog

Because I'm working as a Python Developer 🐍  (mostly in web) most of the topic will be around the Python/Web/API environment but not only!
I'm interested in software architecture but I'm just starting to broaden my knowledge in this field. 
So I hope you enjoy my educational journey at this blog also 😉

I would like to describe my thoughts, findings, daily changeless and many other things which around my work, interesting and life.

## Enjoy 🎉

If you made it to the end, thank you very much and I hope to "see you" in the next blog post 👋
