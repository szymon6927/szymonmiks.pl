## Intro

Some time ago I created a blog post titled "[History of revealed religions from the philosopher's point of view](/p/history-of-revealed-religions-from-the-philosophers-point-of-view/)".

As you already know, one of my interests besides programming is philosophy.

Today I want to show you another series of lectures given by Professor [Wojciech Sady](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Sady).

The title of this series is "The Great Philosophers".

Unfortunately, the lectures are in Polish :flag-pl: so this blog post is only for my **Polish** audience.

As for now, there are 7 lectures. The previous series ended with 32 lectures :smile: so stay tuned!

## Lectures

They are publicly available on YouTube. Check the link below.

## Let me convince you

The IT industry plays a significant role in shaping the future.
Delving into philosophy helps us grapple with the ethical dilemmas that arise in technology, ensuring our creations contribute positively to society.

Philosophy offers unique problem-solving frameworks that can be applied to IT challenges.
By embracing diverse approaches, we enhance our ability to innovate and overcome obstacles.


## Summary

I encourage you to explore the intersection of IT and philosophy.
The insights gained from Professor Wojciech Sady's lectures might just be the catalyst for a transformative journey.

Let's code not just with syntax, but with wisdom.

Happy learning!
