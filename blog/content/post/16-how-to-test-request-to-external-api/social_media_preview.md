In this blog post, I discuss the importance of writing unit tests for external APIs and explored various tools and techniques to help you do so effectively. We examined the drawbacks of mocking the entire requests library and presented alternative solutions such as responses, wiremock, vcrpy, and using a sandbox environment.

The goal is to create a reliable and maintainable test suite that ensures the proper functioning of our code that interacts with external APIs.

Happy reading and testing!
