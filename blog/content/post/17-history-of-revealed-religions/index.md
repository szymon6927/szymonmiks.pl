## Intro

Some time ago during the Easter break, we went out for a beer :beer: with my fellow programmers.

Besides the IT area, all of us are also interested in history, religion, and philosophy.

**Fun fact about myself, in high school I decided to choose philosophy as an additional subject on my Matura exam. :smile:**

> The Matura exam is a Polish state examination. It is an exam at the end of every Polish high school.
Itâ€™s not obligatory to take this exam, but everyone who wants to attend the University must pass it.

Once we finished discussing IT news :smile: (new JS frameworks included :smile:).
One of them recommend me a series of lectures entitled
"History of revealed religions from the philosopher's point of view" given by Professor [Wojciech Sady](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Sady).

Unfortunately, the lectures are in Polish :flag-pl: so this blog post is only for my **Polish** audience.


## Lectures

They are publicly available on YouTube. Check the link below.

The **"History of revealed religions from the philosopher's point of view"** lectures are a series of **23** lectures
given by Professor [Wojciech Sady](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Sady), in which he discusses key phenomena related to revealed religions.

From the Torah, through the Bible and Koran, these lectures will provide you with a thorough knowledge of revealed religions, which have had a huge impact on human culture and history.

Why should you listen to these lectures?
Firstly, you'll learn many interesting facts and trivia about revealed religions, which are often discussed in a historical or literary context, rather than from a philosophical perspective.
Secondly, these lectures will help you understand how revealed religions have influenced human culture and history, and how they continue to affect our society today.


## Summary
If you're interested in psychology, philosophy, and the history of religions, these lectures are a great source of knowledge for you.
Especially since they are available online for free.

I encourage you to check other lectures given by Professor Wojciech Sady. On his YouTube channel, there is much more :rocket:.

I was so impressed by these lectures, so I decided to put it on my blog firstly to not forget about it, and secondly to share such
valuable content with others :wink:.

Happy watching :movie_camera:!
