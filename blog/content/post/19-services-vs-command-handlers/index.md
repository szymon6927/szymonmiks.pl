## Intro

Organizing code in an application is crucial for its maintainability and scalability.
Two common approaches for structuring code are services and command handlers.
In this blog post, we will explore these approaches and discuss when it is appropriate to use each one.

## Services

Services are an effective way to encapsulate business logic and provide higher-level operations.
They abstract away implementation details and promote code modularity.
Services are particularly useful when handling complex operations that involve multiple components.

Here's an example of a payment service:
```python
class PaymentService:
    ...

    def process_payment(self, amount: Money, payment_method: str) -> None:
        # Validate payment details
        # Process payment
        # Update transaction records
        # Send confirmation email
```

In the code snippet above, the `PaymentService` encapsulates the logic for processing a payment.
It performs validation, processes the payment, updates transaction records, and sends a confirmation email.
By encapsulating these operations in a service, we can keep the code modular and maintainable.

## Command Handlers

Command handlers focus on executing specific commands or actions.
They follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and maintain separation of concerns.
Command handlers are beneficial when we want to handle one specific task or action per handler.

Consider the following example of a command handler for user registration:
```python
class RegisterUserCommandHandler:
    def handle(self, command: RegisterUser) -> None:
        # Validate user input
        # Create user record in the database
        # Send welcome email
```

or in more `Pythonic` way, we can do this like that:

```python
class RegisterUserCommandHandler:
    def __call__(self, command: RegisterUser) -> None:
        # Validate user input
        # Create user record in the database
        # Send welcome email
```

In this example, the `RegisterUserCommandHandler` is responsible for handling the registration of a user.
It validates the user input, creates a user record in the database, and sends a welcome email.
By using command handlers, we can keep our codebase focused and maintain a single responsibility per handler.

## Pros and Cons

Both **services** and **command handlers** have their advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore them in more detail:

### Services:

**Pros:**
- Encapsulation: Services encapsulate business logic, making it easier to manage and reason about.
- Modularity: Services abstract away implementation details, promoting code modularity and reusability.
- Handling complex operations: Services can orchestrate multiple components and handle complex operations effectively.

**Cons:**
- Potential for larger and more complex service classes: As the application grows, services may become larger and harder to maintain.
- Difficulty in maintaining single responsibility: It can be challenging to maintain a single responsibility principle in large service classes.


### Command Handlers:

**Pros:**
- Simplicity: Command handlers focus on specific tasks, making the codebase simpler and more maintainable.
- Single responsibility: Each command handler has a clear responsibility, promoting separation of concerns.
- Ease of testing and maintenance: With command handlers, it's easier to write unit tests and maintain code due to their focused nature.

**Cons:**
- Increased number of classes: As the number of commands grows, the number of command handlers can increase, potentially leading to a larger codebase.
- Potential for duplication of code: Command handlers may share similar logic, leading to duplicated code if not properly managed.

## Choosing the Right Approach

Choosing between services and command handlers depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your application.
Here are some guidelines to help you make an informed decision:
- Consider the complexity and size of your application.
If it involves complex operations and multiple components, services might be a suitable choice.
- Evaluate the level of modularity and separation of concerns required.
If your application requires a high degree of modularity and separation of responsibilities, command handlers can provide a more focused and maintainable approach.
- Think about the potential for code reuse and maintenance.
If there are common functionalities or operations that need to be reused across different parts of your application, services can help promote code reuse.
On the other hand, if you anticipate frequent changes or updates to specific actions or tasks, command handlers can make maintenance and testing easier.
- Consider the level of testing required for the application.
If your application requires extensive testing at the command level or if you're following a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern, command handlers can facilitate unit testing and provide a clear separation between commands and queries.

By carefully considering these factors and understanding the trade-offs of each approach, you can choose the approach that best aligns with your application's needs, promoting code maintainability, and scalability.

Remember to document this decision! You can use [ADRs](/p/what-is-an-adr/) to do this.

### Outro
Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.
The choice between services and command handlers depends on the unique characteristics of your project.
By carefully evaluating the complexity, modularity, code reuse, and testing requirements, you can select the approach that best aligns with your application's needs.

Code organization and maintainability are key factors in the long-term success of any software project.
So, take the time to plan and structure your codebase thoughtfully, keeping in mind the principles and patterns discussed in this blog post.

I hope this article has provided you with valuable insights into the services vs. command handlers debate and helps you make informed decisions in your projects.

Happy coding! :rocket:
